Webhooks
********

Webhooks allow for seamless integration with external systems by automatically sending HTTP POST requests when
specific events occur within the application. This enables automated workflows, real-time synchronization,
and external monitoring.

.. note::
    At the current state of development **Webhooks** are evaluated exclusively for :ref:`Object <objects-anchor>`-based
    events (**CREATE**, **UPDATE** and **DELETE**).


Each webhook is tied to one or more event types and is configured to point to a specific external URL. When a
matching event occurs, the system sends a payload representing the object involved (with relevant context depending
on the action) to the configured endpoint.

This feature is ideal for organizations that need to:

- Sync data to third-party systems (e.g., CMDBs, ticketing tools, or analytics platforms)
- Trigger external automation pipelines
- Log changes or deletions in real-time to external audit systems
- React to system state changes using external scripts or applications

The Webhooks interface includes:

- A **table** displaying all configured webhooks
- A **"View Logs"** button above the table for reviewing past webhook executions
- A **"Create Webhook"** button to configure a new webhook

How Webhooks Work
-----------------

Webhooks are triggered automatically when an :ref:`Object <objects-anchor>` is **created**, **updated**, or **deleted**
in the system.

For each webhook:

- If the event type matches the action (e.g., "create", "update", "delete"), then the webhook is triggered
- The **object payload** (depending on the event) is sent via POST to the configured webhook URL:
  - On *create*: the full created object
  - On *update*: the updated object with the changed fields
  - On *delete*: the full object prior to deletion

.. note::
   Only webhooks with `active = True` are evaluated during event processing.

Webhook Schema
--------------

Each webhook is defined by the following fields:

.. list-table:: Table: Fields for Webhooks
   :widths: 30 70
   :width: 100%
   :header-rows: 0

   * - **Name**
     - A descriptive name for the webhook (e.g., *Sync to External CMDB*)
   * - **URL**
     - The endpoint URL that receives the HTTP POST request when the webhook is triggered
   * - **Event Types**
     - A list of event types that should trigger the webhook. Possible values include:

       - *create*
       - *update*
       - *delete*

   * - **Active**
     - A boolean flag indicating whether the webhook is currently active

Examples
--------

1. **Notify an External Inventory System on Object Creation**

   - **Event Type**: `create`
   - **Webhook URL**: `https://inventory.example.com/api/object-created`
   - **Use Case**: When a new CMDB object (e.g., server, workstation) is created, a webhook automatically
     notifies an external inventory or asset management system with the new object's data.

2. **Log Object Deletions to an Audit Trail System**

   - **Event Type**: `delete`
   - **Webhook URL**: `https://audit.example.com/webhooks/object-deleted`
   - **Use Case**: If a CMDB object is deleted, this webhook sends the deleted object's data (as it
     existed before deletion) to an external audit system for compliance tracking and record keeping.
