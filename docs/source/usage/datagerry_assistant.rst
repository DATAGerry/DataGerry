The **DataGerry Assistant** provides an intuitive and guided setup to help you get started quickly. It launches
automatically the first time you open DataGerry, but you can also start it manually at any time via
**Toolbox ⇒ Assistant** in the top-right menu.

Once launched, the Assistant presents you with a list of common **branches** typically used in CMDB structures
(e.g., IT infrastructure, facilities). You may select one or multiple branches depending on your use case.

After choosing your branches, click **Continue** to proceed to the **profile selection** step. Profiles are
collections of predefined **types** commonly associated with the selected branches. You can refine your setup by
enabling or disabling individual profiles.

Clicking **Create** will automatically generate all **types** defined in your selected profiles. Once the types are
created, you’ll be redirected to the **Type Overview**, which can also be accessed later via **Framework ⇒ Types**.

In the sidebar, your new types will appear under **Categories**, organized according to the branches and profiles
you selected.

In the **Type Overview** table, you can explore and modify any generated type by clicking the **Edit** icon under the
**Actions** column. This gives you a closer look at how types are structured within DataGerry.

You can also define your own types from scratch using the **+ Add** button above the table—tailoring the system
precisely to your needs.
