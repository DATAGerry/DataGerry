        Automatically generates the next enumeration value
        
        This method is internally used by the `auto()` function to assign sequential 
        values to the enum members based on their order of definition.

        Parameters:
        - start (int): The starting value (typically ignored for auto-generation).
        - count (int): The number of existing members before this one
        - last_values (list): A list of previously assigned values

        Returns:
        - The generated value for the next enum member
