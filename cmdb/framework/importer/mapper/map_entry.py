Mapping module for associating data to specific memory areas, such as fields or attributes

This module provides a `MapEntry` class that allows you to create mappings where each entry consists of:
- A `name` (which can be any data type) representing the key or identifier of the mapping
- A `value` (which can also be any data type) representing the data associated with the `name`
- An optional set of configuration `options` that can be used to store additional metadata about the entry
