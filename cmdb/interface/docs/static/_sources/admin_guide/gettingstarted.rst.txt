DataGerry is a versatile asset management tool (or CMDB) that empowers users to define their own data models and store
information in **Objects**. An **Object** represents entities such as routers, servers, locations, or maintenance
contracts, each comprising multiple fields (e.g., management IP, hostname of a router) with specific data types.
Examples of data types include text, checkbox, date, dropdown, and more, allowing for flexible and detailed
data management tailored to individual organizational needs.

In DataGerry, the blueprint for an **Object** is defined by a **Type**. Each **Type** dictates the following details
for all **Objects** belonging to it:

 * Fields and their respective data type
 * Sections to logically group fields
 * Type icon
 * Type name


The type definition can be modified at any time, even if **Objects** of that **Type** already exist.
